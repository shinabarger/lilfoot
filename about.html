                    <h3>Many people feel an ovelwhelming sense of anxiety when it comes to climate change. Because of this anxiety, people do not take action. Our founders also experienced this to be so overwhelming it was hard to take any action at all. Lilfoot was
                        born out of the idea that individuals can make a difference with small and daily steps. We can't do it all, but we can start with something. By changing individually we can change culture and change the environmental behavior of those around us.
